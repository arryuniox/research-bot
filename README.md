goofy ass discord bot that i made to help do research (mainly used for downloading stuff and just doing research from keywords found in the article because modern AI is very bad at this somehow it does like the thing where it summarizes and random stuff and makes up sources and whatnot, and downloading datasets is also smth cool i guess)

ok so a lot of things are broken because of certificate issues with NCBI and PubMed but fixes are going to be coming soon (hopefully, when i have time or is very bored)
